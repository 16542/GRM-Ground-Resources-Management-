There are two JSON files in this repository, contacts.json and alerts.json. Contacts (satellites) is a list of satellites in orbit and includes pertinent information about each device. Alerts is a list of unrelated status alerts with varying levels of severity. You will need to take this JSON data and persist it in a backend database. You will then develop a backend API, to be called upon by your frontend, which will display the data. This dashboard should allow registration and login of a user, requiring a password, and the user's credentials should also be persisted in your database.
